# 361-microservice

Microservice for partner's project for CS 361:
I am implementing a microservice that communicates with HTTP Requests (RESTful API). It will retrieve user-submitted text and analyze the text by using natural language processing techniques such as RAKE to find the keywords which will be used in Brooke's hashtag generator website.
